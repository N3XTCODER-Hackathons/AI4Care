## Short description
This data is from an elderly patient of the geriatric departement of the Charité, gathered by multiple wearables of the brand Withings over the course of 16 days.
Raw data shows every measuring of the data, while aggregates sums them up over the respective day. Since multiple wearables report the heart rate, it is measured in different points of time by different wearables.

## Measures and units

**height.csv:** Height Measurements
- Height : (meters)

**bladder_filling.csv:** Bladder data in percent filling


### Scale ("Body"):

**weight.csv:** Weights Measurements
- Weight : Weight (kg)

### Blood Pressure Meter ("BPM+"):

**bp.csv:** Blood Pressure Data
- Heart Rate : (bpm)
- Systolic : (mmHg)
